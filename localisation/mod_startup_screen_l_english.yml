Empire in the east.\n\nThe Treaty of Tours has left Western Europe with an uneasy truce, one that looks like it could break at any time, due to the ambition of the Kings of §YFrance§!, §YEngland§!, or the Duke of §YBurgundy§!.\n\nIn the north, the Kalmar Union remains in place, despite the deposition of its Pommeranian king by the Hanseatic League, as well as dissident §YSwedish§! and §YDanish§! nobles.\n\nThe §YRussian§! states are barely starting to feel free of the Tatar yoke, as the §YGolden Horde§! continues to fracture, ever since its crushing defeat at the hands of Timur.\n\nAs the High Renaissance approaches, §YItaly§! and §YGermany§! remain fraught by the constant friction between the §YEmperor§! and the many autonomous princes.\n\nThe entire continent is on the verge of major changes, and it will be up to you to lead the §Y[Root.GetAdjective]§! [Root.GovernmentName] through this period."
