 flavor_arh.EVTDESC1:0 "Hail King Ardor! Ruler of Arhna! Kingdom of the thousand flowers! Since the days of the long frost, the Ksann clan has lead arhnan people against threats from both east and west. Now a new chapter begins as the war in the middle kingdoms end, as the magistres of Heirbn announce a new era for the realms of men, elf and orc alike. Look to your arms, as the city state of Siiray has gathered allies to the west, and the ancient kingdom of Vor' Ros has taken dominion of the middle valley and its tribes. Secure your position in central Lothia, and annex the city states, then secure your border against the Solemyrans to the north! "
